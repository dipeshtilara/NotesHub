# üîß Supabase Storage Policy Fix

## Issue Found

‚úÖ Bucket "cbse-resources" exists and is public
‚ùå **Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are blocking uploads**

Error: `new row violates row-level security policy`

---

## Quick Fix - Add Storage Policies

You need to add storage policies to allow uploads and downloads. Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

### üìù SQL to Run:

```sql
-- Storage Policy: Allow public read access to cbse-resources bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public Access for cbse-resources"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'cbse-resources');

-- Storage Policy: Allow authenticated uploads to cbse-resources bucket
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated uploads for cbse-resources"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'cbse-resources');

-- Storage Policy: Allow authenticated updates to cbse-resources bucket
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated updates for cbse-resources"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'cbse-resources');

-- Storage Policy: Allow authenticated deletes from cbse-resources bucket
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated deletes for cbse-resources"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'cbse-resources');
```

---

## Alternative: Disable RLS for Storage (Quick but less secure)

If you want to allow anyone to upload (for testing/development):

```sql
-- WARNING: This allows anyone to upload files
-- Only use for development/testing

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for cbse-resources"
ON storage.objects
FOR ALL
USING (bucket_id = 'cbse-resources')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'cbse-resources');
```

## How to Apply:

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/qqtqtuzewywbpovifnfy/sql/new
2. Paste the SQL above
3. Click "**Run**"
4. ‚úÖ Done!

---

## After Applying:

The application will be **100% functional**:
- ‚úÖ Upload PDFs via Teacher Portal
- ‚úÖ Generate notes
- ‚úÖ Store audio files
- ‚úÖ Students can view everything

---

## Verify Fix:

After running the SQL, test the Teacher Portal:
1. Go to port 8001
2. Upload a sample PDF
3. Should work without errors! üéâ
